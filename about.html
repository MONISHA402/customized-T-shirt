    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Dazzi was founded by Richard (Dick) Ward, Andrew Ward, and Ally (Ward) Delgado, and opened its doors in early 2014. After 28 years in the corporate apparel industry, Dick’s vision was to launch an e-commerce business model that made the gear ordering process faster, cheaper, and more transparent for businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazzi is redefining quality and ease of ordering in the corporate apparel and gifts space. Over our last 9 years in business, we have provided co-branded merchandise to more than 65,000 companies worldwide, including 93% of the current Fortune 500.
